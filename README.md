<h1>Understanding Routing Exercises</h1>

<p>In this exercise we will practice with urls in Flask.</p>
<ul>
<li>localhost:5000/ - have it say "Hello World!"</li>
<li>localhost:5000/dojo - have it say "Dojo!"</li>
<li>Create one url pattern and function that can handle the following examples:</li>
<li>localhost:5000/say/flask - have it say "Hi Flask!"</li>
<li>localhost:5000/say/michael - have it say "Hi Michael!"</li>
<li>localhost:5000/say/john - have it say "Hi John!"</li>
<li>Create one url pattern and function that can handle the following examples (HINT: int() will come in handy! For example int("35") returns 35):</li>
<li>localhost:5000/repeat/35/hello - have it say "hello" 35 times</li>
<li>localhost:5000/repeat/80/bye - have it say "bye" 80 times</li>
<li>localhost:5000/repeat/99/dogs - have it say "dogs" 99 times</li>
</ul>
